# Flurry Screen Saver (Three.js)

A faithful recreation of the classic macOS "Flurry" screen saver using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). This project aims to replicate the original's smooth, swirling ribbon trails with modern WebGL, and includes optional interactivity and performance optimizations.
